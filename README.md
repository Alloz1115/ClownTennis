# ClownTennis
The code for the Clown Tennis Game for the CI Gamers Club Fall 2023 project

## Summary
* A main menu appears when starting the game. When start game is chosen, the tennis game automatically starts. There are no animations as of 11/21 and the tennis ball ricochets off of the players. The only controls are WASD to move the left clown and arrow keys to move the right clown. Pause menu and main menu are functional.

## Controls 
* Main Menu/Pause Menu: Mouse/Click
* Move left clown: WASD
* Move right clown: Arrow keys

## To Be Implemented
* Animations (sprites are in files, they just need to be put into an animation player).
* Sound effects and music

## Known Issues
* Some of the clown sprite images are too large, while others have been resized to 500x507 resolution.
